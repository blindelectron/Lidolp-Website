    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi. My name is Garrett Brown, but I go by Dan Gero online. My favorite hobbies are:</p>

        <p>Actually, this last one is a joke. I have a weakness to heat, and walking for a prolonged period of time tires me out. ðŸ™‚</p>

    <p>Something that seems to surprise a lot of people about me is the fact that I am blind. Technically I would be refered to by most people as visually impaired, because I can see lights and shadows. However, since that is all I can see, the vision I do have is mostly useless. Because of that, I call myself blind.</p>
    <p>The reason people are surprized is because, even in 2024, a lot of them still don't know that blind people are capable of using technology of any kind. Alass, I absolutely can. I can do almost everything sighted people can do, thanks to a nifty invention called a screen reader. And the fact is, I'm nobody special. Thousands of blind people do most of the things I do every single day.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, not everything is a walk in the park for us. You see, developers have to put in the effort to make their application accessible to screen readers. A lot of developers do put in the effort, or they use certain libraries in their applications that take care of the screen reader accessibility part for them. There are a lot of developers, however, who don't make their programs accessible for us. This is usually because, A, the developer works for a company that doesn't really care about us, or B, because they are an indi developer who don't know how to do it. Case in point, I use a program called <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocaloid">Vocaloid</a>. This program is not fully usable with screen readers, so I've had to find inventive ways around the problem. I could name a few more examples, but seeing as this page is about me, I'll save those examples for another place.</p>
    <p>To be finished later.</p>
